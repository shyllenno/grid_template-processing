# grid_template-processing

This grid template helps when first learning on how to use processing, as it is very difficulty to "see" x and y coordinates without the cartesian plane.

This grid is best used when put standing alone on a second tab or as the last piece of the code in your script, which will allow the lines to be always upfront of your drawings.

I personally prefer it on a second tab as I can quick flick, select all and comment out the whole code to "turn off/on" the grid lines.

Happy coding.
